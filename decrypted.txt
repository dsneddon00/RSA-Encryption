Reality slips far away
Fiction comes alive, we start to play
Hope is no more behind a closed door
As we drift away from where we were before
Hope and hopelessness become one
Its all meaningless, weve already begun
Yup, we are all one in the same
Never opposites, we play the same game
So I listen to the world and know right from wrong
Stay focused so I can stay strong
If you ever wonder why Im trapped inside
Its probably just because I told a pack of lies
Maybe a dream, maybe it was pride
Maybe for myself, I often wonder why
Until my very last breath
Im running after life, trying to beat death
Walk a thin line between hope and despair
Running from the truth but its already here
Told so many lies, I dunno if they can find me
Only one life to life, so choose wisely
Heads or tails? Do you even know what side your own?
Does it really matter if its on the same coin?
If you wanna achieve, you gotta believe
The time right now. Theres the door, heres the keys
